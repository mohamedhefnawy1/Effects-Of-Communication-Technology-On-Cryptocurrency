RESEARCH ABSTRACT:

In the modern world where social media apps garner and stockpile people’s time and attention, A person who can influence users on these social apps wields the power to influence trends for particular products from the palm of their hands. When it comes to investments, digital currency, and specifically bitcoin is argued to be the future of finance. And when such an important asset is being discussed on these social media apps, it is crucial to know what the influential people are sharing and how they feel about bitcoin since they have the ability to influence the masses in either direction. In this research, therefore, we examine Twitter as a network of influencers that made bitcoin-related tweets with the power to diffuse their own thoughts and sentiments about bitcoin to their followers. We conducted a social network analysis of our users and their tweets which lets us examine how influential they are and what their sentiment is and therefore by what capacity and direction they might influence the general consensus about bitcoin. The findings of this study show us that communication technology such as twitter and the influential people using this technology contribute to the reputation of digital currencies in a positive way. These findings are important because they show us how the use of global communication platforms might help normalize the idea of a future built on digital currencies.
